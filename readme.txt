hashing implementation
:

My approach to the problem was rather simple for the int hashes I followed your algorithm and for the 2 string hashes I read up on hashing strings from a cornell article and found two different algorithms which I implemented for the lab.

B.

My string conversion functions took in string arguments and then checked the length of the string. one added them together comparing the lengths and then hashing it in a sum . the other multiplied them. It hashes the length value of them.

C. My code could have a much more decriptive process, comments , and my outputs could be more thorough.
